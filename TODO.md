1. Add Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division Functions -- DONE

2. Create similar functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Ensure proper error handling (e.g., division by zero).
Add Error Handling for Invalid Inputs

3. Use try-except blocks to handle non-numeric inputs and display error messages.
Organize Layout (Optional)

4. Add labels for input fields to make it clear which entry corresponds to the first and second number.

Enhance User Interface (Optional)

7. Customize the appearance of buttons, labels, and result windows (e.g., font size, colors).
Change window size and layout for better usability.
Add More Advanced Features (Optional)

8. Add support for additional operations (e.g., modulus, exponents).
Add memory functions (e.g., storing previous results).
Add a Quit Button

9. Create a button to close the application easily.
