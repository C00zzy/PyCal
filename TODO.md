# To-Do List:
Add Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division Functions

Create similar functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Ensure proper error handling (e.g., division by zero).
Add Error Handling for Invalid Inputs

Use try-except blocks to handle non-numeric inputs and display error messages.
Organize Layout (Optional)

Add labels for input fields to make it clear which entry corresponds to the first and second number.
Group buttons (addition, subtraction, etc.) in a more organized way (e.g., using frames).
Refactor the Result Window

Adjust the create_result_window function to show different results (sum, difference, etc.).
Use the same result window for all operations, or allow a new one for each calculation.
Create a Clear Button

Add a button to clear the input fields after a calculation is performed.
Enhance User Interface (Optional)

Customize the appearance of buttons, labels, and result windows (e.g., font size, colors).
Change window size and layout for better usability.
Add More Advanced Features (Optional)

Add support for additional operations (e.g., modulus, exponents).
Add memory functions (e.g., storing previous results).
Add a Quit Button

Create a button to close the application easily.
